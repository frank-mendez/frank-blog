# Binary Tree Postorder Traversal Solution

My first thoughts on solving the problem of postorder traversal of a binary tree involve understanding the nature of postorder traversal and the standard ways to achieve it. Here’s a step-by-step breakdown of my thought process:

1. **Understanding Postorder Traversal**: Postorder traversal is a depth-first traversal method where the nodes are visited in the order: left subtree, right subtree, and then the root node. This requires processing the entire subtree before visiting the root node.

2. **Recursive Approach**:
 - Postorder traversal is naturally suited to a recursive approach because of its depth-first nature.
 - The recursive method would involve defining a helper function that visits the left child, then the right child, and finally processes the current node.

3. **Iterative Approach**:
 - While recursion is intuitive, it can lead to stack overflow for very deep trees due to the limitations of the call stack.
 - An iterative approach can avoid this issue using an explicit stack to simulate the function call stack.
 - The iterative method would involve using a stack to traverse the tree and a mechanism to ensure that each node is processed after its subtrees.

4. **Handling Edge Cases**:
 - Consider the case where the tree is empty (i.e., the root is `null`).
 - Consider the case where the tree has only one node.
 - Handle trees that are skewed (all nodes have only left or only right children).

Given these considerations, the first concrete solution that comes to mind is to use an iterative approach with a stack for better performance and to avoid potential issues with recursion. This approach involves:

- Initializing a stack and setting the current node to the root.
- Using a loop to traverse the tree and process nodes in postorder by:
- Traversing to the leftmost node and pushing nodes onto the stack.
- Handling the right subtree and ensuring nodes are processed in the correct order.

Here is the refined solution using an iterative approach:

```typescript
function postorderTraversal(root: TreeNode | null): number[] {
    const result: number[] = [];
    if (root === null) {
        return result;
    }

    const stack: TreeNode[] = [];
    let current: TreeNode | null = root;
    let lastVisitedNode: TreeNode | null = null;

    while (stack.length > 0 || current !== null) {
        if (current !== null) {
            stack.push(current);
            current = current.left;
        } else {
            const peekNode: TreeNode = stack[stack.length - 1];
            if (peekNode.right !== null && lastVisitedNode !== peekNode.right) {
                current = peekNode.right;
            } else {
                result.push(peekNode.val);
                lastVisitedNode = stack.pop()!;
            }
        }
    }

    return result;
}
```
Let's analyze the time and space complexity of the iterative approach for postorder traversal.

### Time Complexity

In a binary tree, each node is visited exactly once. Here's the detailed breakdown:
- **Initialization**: We start by initializing the stack and setting the current node to the root. This is \(O(1)\).
- **Traversal Loop**: The while loop continues as long as there are nodes in the stack or the current node is not null. Within the loop:
- We push nodes onto the stack and move to the left child until we reach a null node. This operation is \(O(1)\) per node.
- When we reach a null node, we check the top node of the stack and decide whether to visit the right subtree or process the current node. Each of these operations is also \(O(1)\).

Each node is pushed and popped from the stack exactly once, leading to a linear traversal of the tree.

Thus, the overall time complexity is \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the number of nodes in the binary tree.

### Space Complexity

The space complexity is determined by the additional space used by the stack and any auxiliary space required for the traversal.

- **Stack Space**: In the worst case, the stack will hold all nodes in one path from the root to a leaf. This occurs in the case of a skewed tree (where each node has only one child). In such a case, the stack can contain up to \(n\) nodes.
- **Auxiliary Space**: We use a few additional variables like `result`, `current`, and `lastVisitedNode`. These use \(O(1)\) space each.

Thus, the space complexity is dominated by the stack space and is \(O(h)\), where \(h\) is the height of the tree. In the worst case, for a skewed tree, the height \(h\) is \(n\), leading to a space complexity of \(O(n)\). For a balanced tree, the height \(h\) is \(\log n\), leading to a space complexity of \(O(\log n)\).

### Summary

- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the number of nodes.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(h)\), where \(h\) is the height of the tree. In the worst case, this can be \(O(n)\).

These complexities reflect the efficiency of the iterative postorder traversal method.

This approach effectively simulates the recursive postorder traversal using a stack and ensures that each node is processed after its left and right subtrees, providing an efficient solution for the problem.
