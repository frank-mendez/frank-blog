Introduction:
In the competitive landscape of frontend development, React.js has emerged as a powerful library for building dynamic user interfaces. As a senior frontend developer specializing in React.js, preparing for interviews requires a deep understanding of the library's core concepts and best practices. To help you ace your next interview, we've compiled a comprehensive list of 20 React.js interview questions tailored for senior developers.

    1. What is React.js, and what are its key features?
    - Define React.js and discuss its virtual DOM, component-based architecture, and declarative nature.

    2. Explain the difference between class components and functional components in React.
    - Differentiate between class components, which use ES6 classes, and functional components, which are stateless and rely on functions.

    3. What are hooks in React, and how do they differ from class components?
    - Discuss the introduction of hooks in React 16.8, their role in functional components, and how they simplify state management and side effects.

    4. What is JSX, and why is it used in React?
    - Explain JSX as a syntax extension for JavaScript, allowing developers to write HTML-like code within JavaScript files for easier component rendering.

    5. Describe the component lifecycle methods in React.
    - Outline the phases of a component's lifecycle, including mounting, updating, and unmounting, and discuss key methods like componentDidMount and componentDidUpdate.

    6. What is state in React, and how is it different from props?
    - Define state as internal data within a component that can change over time and compare it with props, which are passed down from parent components.

    7. How do you manage state in a React component?
    - Discuss various state management approaches, including useState hook for functional components and this.state for class components.

    8. Explain the concept of props drilling in React.
    - Describe props drilling as the process of passing props through multiple layers of nested components and discuss solutions like context API or state management libraries.

    9. What are controlled components in React?
    - Define controlled components as components whose value is controlled by React state, enabling synchronization between the UI and state.

    10. What are higher-order components (HOCs) in React?
    - Define HOCs as functions that take a component and return a new component, often used for code reuse, logic abstraction, and cross-cutting concerns.

    11. Discuss the importance of keys in React lists.
    - Explain the role of keys in helping React identify which items have changed, been added, or been removed in a list, improving performance and rendering efficiency.

    12. How does React handle forms and form validation?
    - Discuss strategies for handling form input, including controlled components, form submission, and validation using libraries like Formik or custom validation logic.

    13. What are React Router and its key components?
    - Define React Router as a routing library for React applications, including components like BrowserRouter, Route, Switch, and Link for declarative routing.

    14. Explain the concept of lazy loading in React.
    - Describe lazy loading as a technique for optimizing performance by deferring the loading of components until they are needed, using React.lazy and Suspense.

    15. What is the purpose of the useEffect hook in React?
    - Discuss the useEffect hook for managing side effects in functional components, such as data fetching, subscriptions, or DOM manipulation.

    16. How does React handle server-side rendering (SSR)?
    - Explain SSR as the process of rendering React components on the server and sending the pre-rendered HTML to the client, improving initial load time and SEO.

    17. Discuss the role of Redux in React applications.
    - Describe Redux as a state management library for managing application state in complex React applications, including concepts like actions, reducers, and the store.

    18. What are the key differences between React.js and other frontend frameworks like Angular or Vue.js?
    - Compare React.js with other popular frontend frameworks in terms of architecture, syntax, data binding, state management, and community support.

    19. How do you optimize the performance of a React application?
    - Discuss performance optimization techniques such as code splitting, memoization, virtualization, minimizing re-renders, and using production builds.

    20. Can you explain the concept of React Fiber?
    - Introduce React Fiber as a reimplementation of React's core algorithm, enabling asynchronous rendering, prioritization, and better handling of large component trees.

Conclusion:
Mastering React.js interview questions requires a deep understanding of the library's core concepts, best practices, and ecosystem. By familiarizing yourself with these 20 questions tailored for senior frontend developers, you'll be well-equipped to demonstrate your expertise and excel in your next React.js interview. Happy coding!
